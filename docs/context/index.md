@typed/context is a collection of helpers for working with the Effect Context.
You can construct contextual equivalents of your favorite Effect types like
Ref, Hub, Queue, and all the other @effect/io/\* types, as well as construct product
types and ammend them with additional functionality like utilizing and providing your services.

All of these types are equipped with optional helpers to construct opaque interfaces for your services
without a separate type declaration.
