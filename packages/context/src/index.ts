 * @typed/context is a collection of helpers for working with the Effect Context.
 * You can construct contextual equivalents of your favorite Effect types like
 * Ref, Hub, Queue, and all the other @effect/io/* types, as well as construct product
 * types and ammend them with additional functionality like utilizing and providing your services.
 *
 * All of these types are equipped with optional helpers to construct opaque interfaces for your services
 * without a separate type declaration.
