/**
 * Fx<R, E, A> is a representation of an `Effect`-ful workflow that exists over
 * the time dimension. It operates within a context `R`, can fail with an `E`,
 * and succeed with an `A`.
 *
 * Any `Fx`, shorthand for "Effects", can emit 0 or more errors or events over an
 * indefinite period of time. This is in contrast to `Effect` which can only
 * produce exactly 1 error or event.
 *
 * It is defined as a super-type of `Effect`, `Stream`, and `Cause`. This
 * allows for all operators that accept an `Fx` to also capable of
 * accepting an `Effect`, `Stream`, or `Cause`. An Effect or Cause represents a single
 * event or error, while a Stream represents a series of events or errors that will
 * be pulled from the producer as soon as possible.
