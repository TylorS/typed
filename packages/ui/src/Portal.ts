// Portals
// Need a way to control priorities of portals
// Portal service defaults to using document.body
// Each entry can provide an ElementRef to use a different container
// How to manage SSR?
// How to manage things like "click away" events?
//    - Should @typed/template utilize a synthetic event system?
//    - How would we represent it just within the DOM?

// Side-thought we should look into the native <portal> element too for pre-rendering routes we think may be clicked on
